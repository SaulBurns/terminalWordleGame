# terminalWordleGame

**Description:**
Recreated the Wordle game in the computer terminal using Java, with core game
mechanics relying on arrays to store word lists and game states. The program 
ensures robust input validation, checking if the player's guess exists in the
word bank before processing. It also handles potential errors and edge cases
that could disrupt the game, ensuring smooth and reliable performance throughout
each playthrough.

**Installation:**
1. Download the .java and .txt files.
2. Make sure all the files are in the same folder.
3. Compile "Main.java" in the computer terminal.

**Usage:**
1. Run the "Main.java" in the computer terminal and follow the instructions prompted in the terminal.
2. Play and guess the word!
